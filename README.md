# mBvs

# You can check the results of Scenario 4 of simulation in this paper through the code posted here.

# When you download the folder, a folder called mBvs-main is created and Rstudio is executed under this folder.
# This means that the working directory of the Rstudio should be set as follows: "~/mBvs-main"
# Through simulation.R code, the 16th result can be obtained as an example of 120 results of the scenario 4 of the simulation study.

# The data imported from the code was created through the data folder's data.R code.
# The eta value used within the code was determined based on the rules presented in the paper based on the results of the find_eta.R code.
# The description of the arguments of the function is written in the code simulation.R.
