# BVSMed

You can check the results of Scenario 4 of simulation in this paper through the code posted here.

When you download the folder, a folder called BVSMed-main is created and Rstudio is executed under this folder.
This means that the working directory of the Rstudio should be set as follows: "~/BVSMed-main"


The data imported from the code was created through the data folder's data.R code.
The eta value used within the code was determined based on the rules presented in the paper based on the results of the find_eta.R code.
The description of the arguments of the function is written in the code simulation.R.
